User Guide
----------

The two topmost buttons in the menu will bring you to Draw Mode and Run Mode, respectively.

In Draw Mode, you can draw a line on the canvas which will segment into distinct dominoes upon releasing the mouse button.

In Run Mode, you will see the currently loaded line of dominoes in 3D with red wireframe dominoes on a blue floor.

In either mode, you can click the "Load Setup" and "Save Setup" buttons to load the most recently saved domino setup and save a new one, respectively.

In Run Mode, you can click "Play Sequence" to begin tilting the first domino and start the sequence of toppling. You can also click "Reset Dominoes" to reset all dominoes to a standing position. Finally, you can click "Freeze" at any time during the falling of dominoes to freeze or un-freeze their motion.
