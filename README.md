The two topmost buttons in the menu will bring you to Draw Mode and Run Mode, respectively.

In Draw Mode, you can draw a line on the canvas which will segment into distinct dominoes upon releasing the mouse button.

In Run Mode, you will see the currently loaded line of dominoes in 3D with red wireframe dominoes on a blue floor.
